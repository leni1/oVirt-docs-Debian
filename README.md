# oVirt-docs-Debian
Documentation for running oVirt on Debian Testing. 

TL;DR: Go straight to oVirt-Development-Environment.md

This is an attempt to document the process of building oVirt for Debian. As of now, since oVirt isn't in the Debian packages, the way to do it is by setting up a development environment of sorts. The environment I'm using is Debian Testing so you may run into issues specific to the distribution you're running. 
This is a work in progress. I'll add to it as I go along. If you'd like to add something or something didn't work out as expected, send me a pull request or open an issue. I'll do my best to respond in either case. Happy building :)
